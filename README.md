# QA_Portfolio
Repository dedicated to my personal Quality Assurance (QA) projects. Here I share studies, test automations, manual and exploratory testing practices, as well as applied examples in different contexts. The goal is to showcase my QA skills and build experience while preparing for my first professional opportunity.
